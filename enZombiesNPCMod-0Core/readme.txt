enZombies NPCMod Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch mod does two things:

1) Allows NPCMod entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome. 

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for NPCMod entities. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.
