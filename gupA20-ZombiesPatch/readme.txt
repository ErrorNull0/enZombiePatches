Guppy Zombies A20 Patch for enZombies v1.1
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does the following:

- Modifies the Guppy zombies to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over which Guppy zombies spawn in which biome situation.

- updated Localization.txt to include friendly on-screen display names for the zombies.

- Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Guppy zombies. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.
