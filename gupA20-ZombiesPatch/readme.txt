Guppy Zombies A20 Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does the following:

1) Modifies the Guppy zombies to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over which Guppy zombies spawn in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Guppy zombies. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

3) The original mod does not include any spawning behavior, so this patch mod adds the zombies to biome wilderness spawning, screamer scout hordes, POI sleepers, bloodmoon horde, and some of the wandering hordes.

4) The original mod uses the same generic values on all zombies for health, exp gain, attack damage, and damage resist. And, all zombies used that same male zombie voice. This patch mod adds variations to these aspects where it makes sense for each zombie and also ensures that female zombies use famale zombie voices and use the female dance type.
