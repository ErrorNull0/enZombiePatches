MickkPewPew Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the MickkPewPew mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over where the MickkPewPew entities spawn in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the MickkPewPew entities. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

** The main MickkPewPew mod was created by MickkPewPew. I do not claim any credit.
