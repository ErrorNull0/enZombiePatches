Robeloto Zombie Patch for enZombies v1.1
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12229-robelotos-a20-modlets/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the Robeloto custom zombies mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over which Robeloto zombies spawn in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Robeloto zombies. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.


Version 1.1:
- updated to match new robeloto zombies and zombie tweaks the were added on Feb 22 2022
- updated zombie body harvest for latest robeloto zombies from Feb 22 2022
- removed reference to wasteland game animal spawning

Version 1.0:
- removed full Robeloto Add-on and decided to use a simpler patch design
