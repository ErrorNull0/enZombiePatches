Zulk Zombie Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12229-robelotos-a20-modlets/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the Zulk zombie mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over which Zulk zombies spawn in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Zulk zombie. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

Version 1.0:
- removed unneeded custom spawn groups to allow original Zulk mod control over them
