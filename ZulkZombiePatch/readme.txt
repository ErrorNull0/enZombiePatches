Zulk Zombie Patch for enZombies v1.1
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the Zulk zombie mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over which Zulk zombies spawn in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Zulk zombie. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

** The main Zulk zombie mod was not created by me. Link to download the main Zulk mod:

Version 1.1:
- removed reference to wasteland game animals for spawning
- updated zulk 'sizescale' property to correct feet positioning to touch the ground

Version 1.0:
- removed unneeded custom spawn groups to allow original Zulk mod control over them
