This patch allows enZombies and Undead Legacy to run together. 
The conflict areas that is patched is the spawning.xml and gamestages.xml files. 

Instructions: 

Go into your 7 Days "Mods" folder.

Since you should already have the Undead Legacy mod installed, you should
see a folder called UndeadLegacy_Content01. Make a backup of this folder.

Within the enZombiePatches zip file, there is a folder called "UndeadLegacyPatch".
Go into that folder and you will see "UndeadLegacy_Content01" folder.
Important: Copy this UndeadLegacy_Content01 folder and paste it directly onto the
existing UndeadLegacy_Content01 folder that is in your Mods folder.

If your computer asks if you want to overwrite, you want to proceed to overwrite.
This is what will make the needed changes to your current install of Undead Legacy to work with enZombies. 

Tested with Undead Legacy v2.5.47.
