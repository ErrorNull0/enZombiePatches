enZombies NPCMod GoblinzPack Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod GoblinzPack Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 2-GoblinzPack

This patch mod allows the NPCMod Goblinz Pack entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod Goblinz Pack entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome.
