MickPewPews ServerSide Zeds Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the MickPewPews ServerSide Zeds mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This mod also adds spawning of these zombies in the screamer scout hordes and bloodmoon horde.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the MickkPewPew entities. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

** The main MickPewPews ServerSide Zeds mod was created by MickkPewPew. I do not claim any credit.
