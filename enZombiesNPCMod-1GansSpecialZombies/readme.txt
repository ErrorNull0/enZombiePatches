enZombies NPCMod GansSpecialZombies Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod GansSpecialZombies Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-GansSpecialZombies

This patch mod allows the NPCMod GansSpecialZombies entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod GansSpecialZombies entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome. 

** NPCMod GansSpecialZombies Pack (1-GansSpecialZombies) is created by GanTheGrey and not by me. I am not claiming any credit. Link to NPCMod page here:
