enZombies NPCMod SpiderPackColony Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod SpiderPack Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-NPCXSpiderPack
- enZombiesNPCMod-1SpiderPack
- 2-NPCXSpiderPack-ColonyExpansion

This patch mod allows the NPCMod SpiderPack Colony entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod SpiderPack Colony entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome. 

** NPCMod SpiderPack Colony (2-NPCXSpiderPack-ColonyExpansion) is created by Xyth and Arramus, and not by me. I am not claiming any credit. Link to NPCMod page here:
