enZombies NPCMod SpiderPack Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod SpiderPack Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-NPCXSpiderPack

This patch mod allows the NPCMod SpiderPack entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod Spiderpack entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome.
