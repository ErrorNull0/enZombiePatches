Diamond Raid Boss Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the Diamond Raid Boss mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over where Diamond Raid Boss spawns in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Diamond Raid Boss. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

** The main Diamond Raid Boss mod was created by Arcueid/Gray Sage.
