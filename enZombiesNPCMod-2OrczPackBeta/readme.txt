enZombies NPCMod OrczPackBeta Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod OrczPackBeta Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 2-OrczPackBeta

This patch mod allows the NPCMod OrczPackBeta entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod OrczPackBeta entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome.
