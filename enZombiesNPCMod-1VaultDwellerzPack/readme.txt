enZombies NPCMod VaultDwellerzPack Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod VaultDwellerzPack Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-VaultDwellerzPack

This patch mod allows the NPCMod VaultDwellerzPack entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod Vault Dwellerz entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome.
