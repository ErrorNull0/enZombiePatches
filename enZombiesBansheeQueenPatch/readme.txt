Banshee Queen Patch for enZombies v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

This patch does two things:

1) Modifies the Banshee Queen zombie mod to work with enZombies. Specifically, it appends the new spawning groups for outside wilderness spawning that is required by enZombies into the entitygroups.xml file. This results in more control over where Banshee Queen spawns in which biome situation.

2) Provides the option to enable zombie body harvesting for the Banshee Queen. Go to the entityclassses.xml file to enable this.

** The main Banshee Queen mod was created by Arcueid/Gray Sage.
