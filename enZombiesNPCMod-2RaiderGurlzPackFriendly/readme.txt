enZombies NPCMod RaiderGurlzPackFriendly Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod RadierzPackFriendly Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-RaiderGurlzPack
- enZombiesNPCMod-1RaiderGurlzPack
- 2-RaiderGurlzPack_Friendly


This patch mod allows the NPCMod RaiderGurlzPackFriendly entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod RaiderGurlzPackFriendly entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome. 

** NPCMod Raider Gurlz (2-RaiderGurlzPack_Friendly) is created by DarkStarDragon and Mr.Devolver, and not by me. I am not claiming any credit. Link to NPCMod page here:
