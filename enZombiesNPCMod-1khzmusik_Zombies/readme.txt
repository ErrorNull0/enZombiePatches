enZombies NPCMod Khzmusik_Zombies Patch v1.0
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/

The following mods must be installed in order to use enZombies NPCMod Khzmusik_Zombies Patch:

- enZombies
- 0-SCore
- 0-XNPCCore
- 1-khzmusik_Zombies

This patch mod allows the NPCMod Khzmusik_Zombies entities to spawn in the wilderness alongside enZombies. Specifically, it adds the NPCMod Khzmusik_Zombies entites into the new enZombie biome groups defined in entitygroups.xml and called forth by spawning.xml. This also allows more control over which NPCMod entities spawn outside in which biome. 

** NPCMod Khzmusik_Zombies (1-khzmusik_Zombies) is created by Khzmusik and not by me. I am not claiming any credit. Link to NPCMod page here:
